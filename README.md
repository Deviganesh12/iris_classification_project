# iris_classification_project
### IRIS DATASET:   
It contains 5 attributes namely Sepal_length, Sepal_width, Petal_length, Petal_width & class_label .
- INPUTS = Sepal_length, Sepal_width, Petal_length, Petal_width
- OUTPUT = class_label (conains 3 flowers namely Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica & Iris-versicolor.
### CODE EXPLANATION:
- Import the required modules and packages.
- Visualize the Data using the separated Input(x) & Output(y) attributes in Dataset.
- Split our separated data(x,y) into two parts (Training data(80%) & Testing data(20%)).
- Now train the 80% of data using classification algorithm "SVM" (Support Vector Machine).
- Then test the remaining 20% of data & compare it with the original data in dataset.
- Calculate the "Accuracy" to check how accurately the machine predicts the output.
* This is the way how we train a machine (for any dataset) using any ML algorithm & accordingly how
  machine predicts the output based on Accuracy (any metric).
